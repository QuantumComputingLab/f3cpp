/*! \mainpage Overview

F3C++ is an object-oriented, fully templated C++ package for compiling
time-evolution quantum circuits of spin Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free
fermions. F3C++ is build on top of QCLAB++ and provides I/O through openQASM
making it compatible with quantum hardware.


## How to run?

The F3C++ package uses the CMake build system (CMake version ≥ 3.16).
The recommended way of building the F3C++ library is as follows:

1.      Install
        \code {.bash}
        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/f3cpp.git
        \endcode

2.      CMake
        \code {.bash}
        cd f3cpp
        mkdir release
        cd release
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        make -j8
        \endcode

3.      Run tests
        \code {.bash}
        ./test/f3c_tests
        \endcode

4.      Examples
        \code {.bash}
        ./examples/f3c_time_evolution_XY ../examples/XY.ini
        ./examples/f3c_time_evolution_TFXY ../examples/TFXY.ini
        \endcode
        or
        \code {.bash}
        python3 python/f3c_time_evolution_XY.py ../examples/XY.ini
        python3 python/f3c_time_evolution_TFXY.py ../examples/TFXY.ini
        \endcode

5.      Generate documentation
        \code {.bash}
        doxygen doxygen.dox
        \endcode
